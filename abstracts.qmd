| 9:30 - 12:00 | Sousi: Random walks, electrical networks and uniform spanning trees | 
| | Abstract: A random walk is called recurrent if it returns to its starting point infinitely many times with probability one. Otherwise it is called transient. How do we determine whether a walk is transient or recurrent? One way is by viewing the graph as an electrical network and calculating effective resistances. This course will start by developing the theory of electrical networks and the connection to random walks. Kirchhoff in 1847 was the first one to find a connection of spanning trees to electrical networks. Spanning trees in a connected graph are basic objects of great interest in combinatorics and computer science. In this course we will study what a typical spanning tree looks like and we will discuss elegant sampling algorithms using random walks due to Aldous, Broder and Wilson from the 1990's. These connections have yielded many insights on the geometry of uniform spanning trees; this is a topic of intense current research. |
