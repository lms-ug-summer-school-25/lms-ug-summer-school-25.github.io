The aim is to introduce modern mathematics to the best UK undergraduates who will enter their final year the following autumn, and encourage them to think about an academic career in maths. The LMS Undergraduate Summer School consists of a combination of short lecture courses with problem-solving sessions and colloquium-style talks from leading mathematicians. 50 places are available to students per year.\nFor more information about the history of LMS Summer Schools please visit the London Mathematical Society Summer School webpage.\nFor information on how to participate, see the registration page."

Indeed a high level of ability and enthusiasm for mathematics is essential to enjoy and benefit from the LMS Undergraduate Summer School.\nParticipation of women students in the LMS Undergraduate Summer School is particularly important as there is a recognised lack of women continuing on to postgraduate study. To this end UK Institutions are asked to nominate both female and male students."
