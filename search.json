    "text": "The LMS Undergraduate Summer School will take place at the University of Bath, 14 - 25 July 2025.\nThe LMS Undergraduate Summer Schools is a two-week course, which is held every summer at a UK university. The aim is to introduce modern mathematics to the best UK undergraduates who will enter their final year the following autumn, and encourage them to think about an academic career in maths. The LMS Undergraduate Summer School consists of a combination of short lecture courses with problem-solving sessions and colloquium-style talks from leading mathematicians. 50 places are available to students per year.\nFor more information about the history of LMS Summer Schools please visit the London Mathematical Society Summer School webpage.\nNominations for 2025 have now closed. Successful applicants have been contacted."
