    "text": "The LMS Undergraduate Summer School will take place at the University of Bath, 16 - 24 July 2025.\nThe LMS Undergraduate Summer Schools is a two-week course, which is held every summer at a UK university. The aim is to introduce modern mathematics to the best UK undergraduates who will enter their final year the following autumn, and encourage them to think about an academic career in maths. The LMS Undergraduate Summer School consists of a combination of short lecture courses with problem-solving sessions and colloquium-style talks from leading mathematicians. 50 places are available to students per year.\nFor more information about LMS Summer Schools please contact lmssummerschool@lms.ac.uk or visit the London Mathematical Society Summer School webpage."

    "text": "Criteria for Nominations\nTo achieve an inclusive and cooperative working atmosphere, each LMS Undergraduate Summer School is usually limited to 50 in-person participants, so the organisers will need to be highly selective. Indeed a high level of ability and enthusiasm for mathematics is essential to enjoy and benefit from the LMS Undergraduate Summer School.\nParticipation of women students in the LMS Undergraduate Summer School is particularly important as there is a recognised lack of women continuing on to postgraduate study. To this end UK Institutions are asked to nominate both female and male students."
