## Directions

[Campus map](https://www.bath.ac.uk/publications/claverton-down-campus-map/attachments/university-campus-map.pdf)

Bus U1 goes from the train station to the campus. The main bus stop (arrivals square) is close to the accommodation.

It is about a [40 minute walk](https://www.google.com/maps/dir/51.377389,-2.3566945/51.3791194,-2.3287683/@51.3779515,-2.3379405,17z/data=!4m2!4m1!3e2?entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI1MDYxNy4wIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D) from the station to campus (steep uphill in parts). The most convenient pedestrian entrance to the campus (reasonably close to the 4 West building, where the classes and talks take place) is at the intersection by the building labelled "The Woodlands" on the campus map.


## Catering


All meals (breakfast, lunch and dinner) will be provided, starting with dinner on Sunday 13 July and ending with lunch on Friday 25 July, except for some meals at the weekend.
There will also be tea, coffee and biscuit breaks during the days of teaching.

The campus includes a shop which will provide all additional food and any essentials.
